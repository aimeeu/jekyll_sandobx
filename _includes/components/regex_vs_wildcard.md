> A Regular Expression ("regex") is similar to, but different than, a
> wildcard.  You may be familiar with wildcards on your command line,
> where <code>good*</code> would list all files that start with "good".
> In regexes, a * character simply "matches 0 or more of the preceding
> character" -- <code>good*</code> would then match "goo", "good", and
> "goodddddd", but wouldn't match "goodbar".  If you need help with
> the regex syntax, [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
